# `yo_fluq`

This package is focused on Fluent interface to data processing.
The biggest contribution is Python port for C# LINQ-to-objects, or pull-queries.
Also, for some cases when pull-queries do not provide the optimal performance, push-queries are implemented.

`yo_fluq` has 100% test coverage, and most of its code has been in use since the year 2017, so it's safe to use it in the production code.
